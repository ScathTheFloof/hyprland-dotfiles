# My Hyprland Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles for my hyprland setup

## some things you may be wondering
### Why are you using Hyprland
I am testing out different wayland compositors and I chose hyprland\
so now I will daily drive hyprland for a little bit.

### What about the controversy
Listen, from the time that I have been using it. It gets way better when you throw the edgy 15 year old out of the mix\
Plus, Vaxry gets nothing out of this. No money, not even fame and popularity because of the controversy.
And not a lot of people care in the first place. 

### bu..bu..but vaxry did [insert random bad thing that vaxry did}
most of the crap that is thrown his way are lies anyway. and at this point you are getting quite annoying. either use this or not

# Installing
just put the dots into you config, plug and play\
these dotfiles were created on Arch linux, but that doesn't mean that you can apply these to other distros that you probably use.\
